# Resources to learn Algorithms and Problem Solving using Data Structures and Algorithms

 If you would like to learn more about algorithms or practice them, then read on.

## Resources

### Websites

* [GeeksForGeeks](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fundamentals-of-algorithms/) - A great compilation of all the different types of algorithms out there. This website also has tons of pages devoted to problems and code solutions, usually written in C++ or Java.
* [Mathematical problems](http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/) - A resource for mathematics


### Some Videos that We Made
* [Binary Search Trees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov2LTtBtTko)
* [Tries and Graphs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kKDHW1JKsc)


### Practice 
* [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) - to practice solving algorithmic problems in Java, Python, C++ - has an in-built IDE
* [InterviewCake](https://www.interviewcake.com/) - for currently popular interview questions and answers. You do not have to write any code to see hints to the solution. After a limited number of free questions, you will have to sign up/pay. But it's a great resource anyways, and you can sign up for a question/week for free.
* [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/problems) - for more mathematical problems to practice on. Solution explanations are provided after submitting the correct answer (not code)
* [CodingBat for Recursion](http://codingbat.com/java/Recursion-1) - to sink your teeth into simple recursion problems that build up to be more and more difficult. IDE is built in, all in Java. There's also a [second part](http://codingbat.com/java/Recursion-2) to this.
* [Google Code Jam past competition problems](https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/9214486/dashboard) - a nice set of problems that have been used in competitions previously. 


### Language Specific
* [Python](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html) - a really good resource to learn how to work with data structures and algorithms in Python.


### Visualizations
* [Sorting Algorithms](http://www.sorting-algorithms.com/) - visualizations and code in psuedo code, but easily adatpable to Python and Java for all the most common sorting algorithms.
* [Visualgo](http://visualgo.net/) - a nice way to visualize algorithms


### Competitions
* [ACM-ICPC](http://acm.timus.ru/problemset.aspx) - ACM-ICPC hosts coding competitions that may be found here
* [TopCoder (advanced)](http://www.topcoder.com/) - more difficult and challenging algorithmic problems may be found here
* [Google Code Jam](https://code.google.com/codejam) - Google hosts a Code Jam every year with Qualification rounds in April. They also hosted a Code Jam exclusively for women, with winners going to Google I/O. They also have a code practice area if you don't want to compete

### Books
* [Programming Interviews Exposed](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Interviews-Exposed-Secrets-Landing/dp/1118261364) - A really good book that explains the process of writing a solution and then optimizing parts of the solution with goog explanations about why that particular optimization is being done. Solutions in Java
* [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-6th-Programming/dp/0984782850/) - A good book to practice questions and answers from with solutions in Java. This is better after you have a bit more practice, as it contains solutions and optimizations but doesn't hold your hand up to the optimizations.
